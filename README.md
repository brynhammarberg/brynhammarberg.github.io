#Hello World Music :)

"Billie Jean" by Michael Jackson

I'm basically always listening to music (although podcasts are taking over), so I wanted to play around with sounds in my Hello World sketch. The main idea of this sketch is to let you visualize the song being played by turning the amplitude of the song into visible and recorded movement and color; when the song is louder, the shape grows and distorts slightly, and if it's loud enough the shape will change color. Beyond that, I wanted to let the user control both the music and how it's turned into the visual. Moving the mouse up and down will raise and lower the volume, and moving it side to side will change where the sound is coming from; the shape will also change size based on that movement. Different keys also have different commands. "-" and "+" will change how long the shape is recorded until it resets. "i" and "d" increase and decrease the size of the shape. Finally, "e" and "s" change the shape into either an ellipse or a rectangle. I'm looking forward to keep working on this project, and I hope you have as much fun using this as I've had making it!

I've attached some screencaps with different settings & songs.
